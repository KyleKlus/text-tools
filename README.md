# Text Tools

The text tools are a set of free online tools, which help you to work with texts.
It is part of a series of web apps, which are all centered around being free to use, without ads and without any tracking. The idea came to me, because there are so many free to use js libraries but they dont have a ui, so that people can use them without coding knowledge.

## Apps from the series

- [QR Code Generator](https://kyleklus.de/qr-code-generator)
- [Text Tools](https://kyleklus.de/text-tools)

## Features

- Word Counter
- Sentence Counter
- Character Counter
- A whole plethora of text replacement tools
